                <span class="text-muted">Too many files!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Are you a designer, web developer, writer etc.? If so, you have probably created a print/web ready file that is about to be published/printed when... the dreaded last minute change occurs, it goes off for final approval and there's another change and so on. You file directory might look something like this: <br> graphicdesign_PRINT.pdf <br> graphicdesign_PRINT_Final.pdf <br> graphicdesign_PRINT_final2 then 3 then 4 and so on. You end up with multiple files that might only have a spelling change but you don't want to get rid of the file just in case you need it because you know when you delete that file the client will want to revert back to it someday.</p>
            <p class="lead"> What happens if there are multiple people working on the same files? How do you to keep track of the most current file? This is where we introduce Version Control Systems (VCS); a system that records changes to file(s), who made the change, what they changed, when it changed, compare changes with other users and revert back to specific time period if needed.</p>
            <p class="lead"> There are multiple VCS, some work on Unix-like, Microsoft, Mac OS X, Linux etc. Some software is free and others charge a license.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Collaboration made easy.</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A typical project would have a graphic designer, web developer, software manager, a writer, a project administrator, a project manager etc. When any one of these professionals works on their own computer system this is known as a Local Version Control System. Can they all work seamless on a project with the same files over many continents and time zones? Yes, with the use of Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) or a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS). </p>
            <p class="lead">CVCS vs DVCS which is better? A CVCS allows you to synchronize, track, back-up and commit files to a centralized location. You would pull down any changes to be made from a central server, you make your change and you commit these changes back to the central server for other to see. Whereas, DVCS allows you to collaborate with others and share a snapshot of the changes made. With DVCS you have access to the whole file structure/repository and are able to work locally and offline if needed. You only need to be online to share your changes.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. It is designed for small scale projects to extremely large projects with multiple users. Git is used locally so there isn't the need to always be connected to the internet, this streamlines projects. Everyone working on a project has a full history of the repository on their system. Git tracks these files by organizing and storing snapshots of content differences with embedded metadata: what changed, who changed what, when it changed and a description of why it changed. Project files can be edited simultaneously by multiple users and merged into one by pushing the files to a centralized repository. </p>
            <p class="lead">Each user is able to have independent multiple local branches with an endless number of workflows. When the user is ready to commit the changes they can be 'pushed' to the remote repository. The user doesn't have to push the whole repository just the changes they have made. </p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">

                <span class="text-muted">Workflow</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states that your files can be in: Committed, modified and staged. <br> Committed means the data is stored locally in the Git directory <br> Modified means you have changed the file but it isn't staged. <br> Staged means you are making a modified file ready for your next snapshot.<br> </p>
            <p class="lead"> There are three main sections of a Git workflow: The Working Tree/Directory, The Staging Area and the Git Directory/Repository. <br> Working Tree/Directory: You MODIFY files <br> You STAGE files: Add snapshots to the staging area. <br> The GIT DIRECTORY/REPOSITORY: You permanently commit a snapshot.</p>
            <p class="lead"> Files are seen as either tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files taken from the last snapshot whether they are unmodified, modified or staged where as untracked files are files that were not in the last snapshot or staging area. </p>
              <p class="lead"> An example process: <br> You create a new local Git repository <br> Add a new file to the repository (UNTRACKED) <br> When ready to TRACK the file we add it to the STAGING area and we take a snapshot/picture <br> When ready to COMMIT this file for the first time (the snapshot from the STAGING area) <br> We work on it some more and we add new files. <br> Both files need to be added to the STAGING area. <br>When ready we COMMIT the changes to the REPOSITORY.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git can be in the command line in Terminal on a MAC, using Command Prompt on Windows or in a graphical user interface.</p>
            <p class="lead"> These are some common Git commands: <br> git init - Creating a new Git repository <br> git log - Looking at the repository history, how many commits preformed, date and the author <br> git checkout --filename - Replaces changes in your working tree with the last snapshot <br> git pull - Updating to the newest commit <br> git merge branchname - Merging one branch to the master branch <br> git add - There are multiple ways to add a list of files, all types of files such as .txt in the current directory or sub directories or even adding a whole project. <br> git commit -m - Adding a snapshot to the top of the master branch timeline <br> git status - Tells you what branch you are on </p>
